(We Are) New Brown America | Goldwin Smith Hall 142 |Shivani Parikh|5|"In Hasan Minhaj's ""Homecoming King"" Netflix special, he coined the phrase ""New Brown America” to name this American-Born (somewhat Confused) Desi generation. What is the South Asian American identity, where do we fit in the broader term of ""Asian,"" and what does it mean to have the ""audacity of equality""? This workshop will open conversation about the post-9/11 criminalization of Desis and explore the movements and coalitions created and fostered by South Asian civil rights organizations, nonprofits, and social justice platforms. We will start and end in a group discussion and identify our hopes and dreams for Desi-Americans' political participation, where the gaps are, and how we as the New Brown America can shape this movement towards collective liberation."||

Homeland: Finding Place Between Asia and America | Morrill Hall 106 |Ada Zhang, Sabrina Cheung, & Helen Yang|5|"What is home? Constructing an identity around place as an Asian American varies widely from person to person, whether that means choosing ""between"" Asia and America or shaping an identity that lies somewhere ""between"" Asia and America. This workshop first delves into the basics of how AAPIs are categorized, touching on the racial binaries of Asia versus America, the perpetual foreigner myth, and AAPI communities' place in America. Then, we will explore and discuss issues pertaining to the idea of ""home"" for Asian Americans; the search for belonging in Asia or America or both; the relationship with language, culture, and heritage; and the role of place and home in different regions of America."||
Mental Health and Self-Identity | Morrill Hall 107 |JR Kuo, NAAPIMHA|5|We will explore their internal and external identities and how that may impact their own health and wellness. We will also focus on empowering ourselves through appreciation of our heritage and strengths.

Grace Lee Boggs and the Black Radical Tradition | Morrill Hall 110 |Emily Dong & Archishman Raju|5|Grace Lee Boggs was a long-time activist, thinker, and revolutionary. She made an essential contribution to a history that defines our time today: from the first March on Washington to the Black Power and revolutionary union movements. With her husband and comrade Jimmy Boggs, she would spend most of her life in Detroit, supporting and leading the struggles throughout the city’s industrial boom and post-industrial devastation. We'll talk about Grace's roots in the Black Radical Tradition, challenge the way current Asian American activist communities frame her, and draw lessons from her ideas and life to inform our own pursuit for transformative justice.  ||
Diversity at The Department of State - Career and Student Opportunities | Morrill Hall 111 |Sarah Cline|5|Recruiter Sarah Cline from the U.S. Department of State will discuss diversity initiatives at the State Department as well as career and student opportunities.||
Reproductive Rights and Organizing: Our Bodies! Our Freedom! | Rockefeller Hall 102 |Kenneth Gonzales, Planned Parenthood Action Fund & Alanna Salwen, Planned Parenthood Generation Action|5|In the last year, we have seen the constant attacks on reproductive healthcare and access globally, nationally, statewide and locally in campuses/universities. However, we have also witnessed the numerous ways communities have defended the attacks on our health, our safety, and our general well-being. Through this workshop, ECAASU participants can expect to engage in conversations around the current fight for reproductive rights and how to take action as young people!||
Anti-Blackness in the Blasian Context | Rockefeller Hall 103 |Savannah Lagmay & Chelsey Gao|5|When discussing AAPI identity, Blasian-- individuals of mixed African and Asian descent--narratives are often excluded in mainstream conversations. How do we tackle this anti blackness within our own communities? Many factors affect Blasian identity and portrayal in the AAPI community, from history within the US to transnationally in modern media representations. “Anti Blackness in the Blasian Context” aims to discuss experiences being and growing up Blasian, how to prioritize Blasian narratives in the community, and how to navigate conversations of anti blackness from and regarding Blasian perspectives.||
Race, Gender, and the Construction of Asian American Masculinity | Rockefeller Hall 104  |Nicholas Hatcher|5|For people of color, gender is often deviant by default. Black and Latinx men are seen as hyper masculine and women as aggressive or overtly sexual. Asian men are emasculated and Asian women are considered submissive. In this workshop, we explore the history and construction of Asian American masculinity and explore what that means in terms of toxic masculinity, mental health, and queer identity.||
Breaking the GenerAsianal Boundaries | Rockefeller Hall 105 |Timothy Chow & Shawn Chen|5|A discussion about the relationship between Asian-Americans and their parents. In particular, how the contrasting backgrounds and cultures between generations express emotions and how that has affected Asian-Americans growing up.

We Are the Ones We’ve Been Waiting For | Rockefeller Hall 112 |Helena Wong, Israt Audry, Van Sam|5|AAPIs have always been involved in movements for justice.  In this period of escalated attacks on communities of color, poor communities, LGBTQ people, women's bodies, the environment, etc., it is important for us to build common language and across identities.  Facilitators will work with participants to understand the current moment, and share the work of organizations from across the country who are working to fight systemic racism and articulating a vision for a world we build together.||
If Jeremy Lin and Kenyon Martin fight, who wins?  White Supremacy | Rockefeller Hall 115 | Karen Yiu & Arushi Saini|5|Horizontal violence occurs when marginalized communities hold each other down, but how do we fix the problem if we do not first recognize our own privilege and bias? Through this workshop, participants will consider the many identities that exist within the Asian American community to better understand how to support the community as a whole. Furthermore, what is the role of Asian American allyship with other marginalized communities and movements such as Black Lives Matter? We will discuss horizontal violence through examples of cultural appropriation and media representation, and discuss how the Asian American community can serve as an agent of change.||
Asian American Christianity | Rockefeller Hall 127 |Christine Lee & David Choi|5|Our identities and experiences are made up of many things, one of which often includes faith background. Despite the monumental role of faith in many people’s lives, Asian/Americans in Christian spaces are not often given the space or the language to understand what it means to be both Asian/American and Christian. One might ask: Does my Asianness even matter to God? This workshops seeks to unpack the intersections of these two points of identity, as well as give an introduction to Asian American theology. Folks do not need to be Christian to participate.||
Advocating Against Adversity | Rockefeller Hall 128 |Andrew Lo, Stephanie Wong, & Sina Uipi, OCA Asian Pacific American Advocates|5|Today’s political environment is divisive.

Yolk Inside an Eggshell: Asian Imagery in Western Media | Rockefeller Hall 132 |Justin Chu, Richard An, & Vinh Dang|5|"The title of our workshop, ""Yolk Inside an Eggshell: Asian Imagery in Western Media,” draws inspiration from an age-old problem: the superseding of Asian actors and actresses for  Caucasian actors and actresses. This workshop aims to give attendees a perspective on the great achievements of Asian actors/actresses in media from past to present. We will highlight the major issues associated with type casting Asian actresses and actors, as well as bring attention to the representation of Asians in media. Together, we will create our own skits on a moment in our lives when we were stereotyped and underestimated. "||
Beyond the Model Minority | Rockefeller Hall 183 |Grace Vu|5|“The Model Minority” It’s a term that’s haphazardly tossed around; but, what are the implications of this term used to describe the Asian American population? And how do these implications affect other minorities? Together, we’ll take a look at the relationship between Asian Americans, Black Americans, and White Americans and explore the concepts of racial hierarchy and power dynamics between racial groups. This workshop will revolve around understanding the institution of racism in American society and how it relates to the theories on Racial Triangulation (C. Jean Kim). Identify the stratification of privilege amongst racial groups and engage in rich discussion that digs deeper into what it reallys means to be an Asian American in today’s society. ||
Establishing the Double Conditional Visibility of Transracially Asian Adoptees in Adoption Media | Rockefeller Hall 189 |Suzi Birnbaum|5|This presentation will investigate the excluding nature of the term “Asian American” in the context of Asian-to-American adoption. Transracial adoption films will be used as examples to show how general definitions of Asian American identity are centered around the “Asian American experience” of not only having Asian racial heritage, but also being raised in and identifying with the Asian American culture. When looking at films/documentaries relating to transracial Asian adoption, there is a dominating trope - one that I label the “kinship-roots narrative” - that allows adoptee visibility, but only if it obeys the strict portrayal of an adoptee. The goal of this workshop is to be the alternative representation of adoptees that it calls for.||
Someday I’ll Love Me | Rockefeller Hall 230 |Paul Tran|5|Writing radical love poems for queer and trans communities “Don’t be afraid,” Ocean Vuong writes in “Someday I’ll Love Ocean Vuong,” after Roger Reeves and Frank O’Hara. And it’s true. In a country where state violence, homelessness, and suicide disproportionately impact communities that are queer, trans, and people of color, fear digs graves for the living and often elude our efforts to triumph, seek happiness, and fulfill our dreams. In this workshop, participants will read Vuong and Reeves. We will talk about what radical love might look like for us and the people we fight for. We will write original work—love poems to us—that confront what we fear most and discuss the role that poetry as self-care plays in every revolution. |Trigger/content warning: suicide|
Centering Empathy in Communication | Rockefeller Hall B16  |Andrea Namkung, Leangelo Acuna, & Kevin Koo|5|With the varying levels of APIA knowledge and advocacy engagement within student spaces, the ability to navigate personal discussions effectively, yet respectfully, is more important than ever before. This workshop aims to deconstruct elitism surrounding the activist and social justice language used today when discussing APIA issues and also to reimagine what it means to facilitate meaningful communication and center our real-life experiences. We hope that participants will leave with the capacity to facilitate meaningful conversations, with the mindset of playing the educator role without overstepping boundaries, and with a newfound focus on empathy-based organizing and action.||
My Name Is... | Rockefeller Hall 110 |Eurie Kim|5|"Personally, growing up as an Asian American without an ""Americanized"" name, I was subject to jokes about my name. These jokes were not necessarily cruel in nature, but for a good amount of time, I think I resented my own name, although eventually, I grew to appreciate and love my name. Through this workshop, I wish to open a discussion of the power of names; what our (as in the APIA community) names mean to us, especially for those of us with non-Americanized first names; and to expand this to question what names we refer to ourselves but also to others outside our community."|Trigger/content warning: discussion of racial slurs|
The Language Barrier | Goldwin Smith Hall 162 |Averill Wong & Yvonne Yang, Cornel Asian & Asian American Center (A3C)|5|The ability to communicate what we feel, share experiences, and form relationships is dictated by the power of language. When we can’t communicate with family and peers, often we lose out on understanding others’ history and culture. This workshop aims to open discussion on the difficulties Asians and Asian Americans might face when conversing to family, friends, and people in another country in a non-native tongue, and how to overcome this barrier.||
Be Loud! Be Proud! Be Genki! | Goldwin Smith Hall 132 |The Genki Spark|6|Based in Boston, The Genki Spark is a pan-Asian women’s arts and advocacy group using personal narratives and Japanese taiko drumming to develop leadership, bash stereotypes, and inspire.

Lifting the Veil: On Illusions Surrounding Hinduism | Goldwin Smith Hall 142 |Abhi Ramakrishnan, Smita Bhoopatiraju, & Kimaya Raje|6|In this workshop, we will map the history of Hinduism, how it is practiced today, variations in in practice, misconceptions, and delve into issues among the community of Hindus in America. We will discuss how interfaith events can be used to strengthen minority communities.

Tongue Tied: Interpreting Asian American Emotion | Goldwin Smith Hall 164 |Luna Ly, Sean McGovern|6|Do we, as AAPI’s, face unique challenges when expressing emotions? Have you ever felt like it’s hard to talk to your family or community about emotionally-charged issues like sexuality or gender identity? We (Luna and Sean) often find ourselves trying to bridge a linguistic divide that stems from an intersectional struggle with culture, translation, gender, and immigrant identity. In this workshop, we’ll look at media tropes of AAPI emotion and compare them to our linguistic realities. This session will help you think critically about your own experiences and how they fit into a larger context of AAPI emotional expression.|Trigger/content warning: Intergenerational trauma, mental health, sexuality, gender identity, language barriers|

Intergenerational Communication | Morrill Hall 107 |JR Kuo, NAAPIMHA|6|Too often, Asian American and Pacific Islander students find themselves at a loss on how to communicate to older generations about general or their own mental health topics.

This workshop breaks down issues surrounding the lack of conversation within families about mental health, and seeks to provide resources and solutions for better intergenerational communication.||

Decolonizing Education: The Fight for Asian American Studies | Rockefeller Hall 112 |Xiao Yin Ma & Alice Li|6|The greatest irony in the current system is that universities, which are designed to provide us with an education, are really the inhibitors of knowledge - the knowledge of our histories.

Critical Nostalgia: Heritage & Asian Artists in the North American Diaspora | Rockefeller Hall 127 |Florence Yee|6|Often caught between the White gaze of the art world and our own self-romanticizing pitfalls, visual artists have used critical histories to help dismantle stereotypes of exoticism and Orientalism. At the same time, there are aspects of our identity that could become complicit to settler-colonialism and other forms of oppression if left unspoken.

It shows the ways in which Asian artists from the diaspora have navigated their identity and its presentation through a critical nostalgia. ||

Anti-Blackness in the Blasian Context | Rockefeller Hall 104 |Savannah Lagmay & Chelsey Gao|9|When discussing AAPI identity, Blasian-- individuals of mixed African and Asian descent--narratives are often excluded in mainstream conversations. How do we tackle this anti blackness within our own communities? Many factors affect Blasian identity and portrayal in the AAPI community, from history within the US to transnationally in modern media representations. “Anti Blackness in the Blasian Context” aims to discuss experiences being and growing up Blasian, how to prioritize Blasian narratives in the community, and how to navigate conversations of anti blackness from and regarding Blasian perspectives.||
Asian American Christianity | Rockefeller Hall 105 |Christine Lee & David Choi|9|Our identities and experiences are made up of many things, one of which often includes faith background. Despite the monumental role of faith in many people’s lives, Asian/Americans in Christian spaces are not often given the space or the language to understand what it means to be both Asian/American and Christian. One might ask: Does my Asianness even matter to God? This workshops seeks to unpack the intersections of these two points of identity, as well as give an introduction to Asian American theology. Folks do not need to be Christian to participate.||
My Name Is... | Rockefeller Hall 110 |Eurie Kim|9|"Personally, growing up as an Asian American without an ""Americanized"" name, I was subject to jokes about my name. These jokes were not necessarily cruel in nature, but for a good amount of time, I think I resented my own name, although eventually, I grew to appreciate and love my name. Through this workshop, I wish to open a discussion of the power of names; what our (as in the APIA community) names mean to us, especially for those of us with non-Americanized first names; and to expand this to question what names we refer to ourselves but also to others outside our community."|Trigger/content warning: discussion of racial slurs|
We Are the Ones We’ve Been Waiting For | Rockefeller Hall 112 |Helena Wong, Israt Audry, Van Sam|9|AAPIs have always been involved in movements for justice.  In this period of escalated attacks on communities of color, poor communities, LGBTQ people, women's bodies, the environment, etc., it is important for us to build common language and across identities.  Facilitators will work with participants to understand the current moment, and share the work of organizations from across the country who are working to fight systemic racism and articulating a vision for a world we build together.||

Critical Nostalgia: Heritage & Asian Artists in the North American Diaspora | Rockefeller Hall 127 |Florence Yee |9|Often caught between the White gaze of the art world and our own self-romanticizing pitfalls, visual artists have used critical histories to help dismantle stereotypes of exoticism and Orientalism. At the same time, there are aspects of our identity that could become complicit to settler-colonialism and other forms of oppression if left unspoken. This workshop explores the nuances of dis/empowerment when it comes to denying or including visual elements of our heritage in artwork. It shows the ways in which Asian artists from the diaspora have navigated their identity and its presentation through a critical nostalgia. ||

This workshop will be held in a roundtable discussion so that everyone can share. There will be no formal hierarchy. Instead the facilitators will act as guides through the discussion. |Trigger/content warning: rape, sexual assault, abuse, self injurious behavior, mental illness, suicide|
Cut and Paste Revolution: A Zine Workshop | Rockefeller Hall 230 |Mimi Thi Nguyen|9|Zines (pronounced “zeens”) and self-publishing have a long and rich history, from pamphlets during moments of political uprising, to fan fiction, to underground zines documenting the punk scene in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw an explosion of zine publishing, with everything from poetry and personal writing, to food and record reviews, to zines about work, cats, health, feminism, race and racism, and everything in between. What all zines have in common is that their writers and editors (often the same people/person) feel like they have something important to say that they would like to share with others. In this workshop, we will discuss how zines can create a collective conversation, and collaborate on making a conference zine and/or individual one-page zines. ||
Reimagining AAPI Identity in Visual Culture | Rockefeller Hall B16 |Kate Pangilinan & Hannah Song|9|How do you currently see AAPI voices represented in media? Can you relate? This workshop will take a close look at AAPI representation within tv, film, art, and social media. We aim to create a space where attendees will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of inclusive storytelling, the development of identity, and building shared cultural knowledge. We will provide the framework and questions for people to evaluate the portrayal of AAPI individuals within art, media, and the growing digital landscape. This workshop highlights the responsibility of storytellers (whether written, visual, or through production) to create the future. Through “Reimagining AAPI Identity in Visual Culture,” we allow folx to recognize the impact of each of our authentic voices—encouraging people to have agency and insert new perspectives and conversations into contemporary media culture.||
Resist, Fight, Mobilize Through Asian Immigration in the U.S. | Rockefeller Hall 132 |Huy Tu & Mike Chiang|9|We shall share and look at the historical context and resistance background that surrounds history of Asian immigration. As we break down different aspects of immigration and citizenship, we hope to expose a new understanding of how the history of immigration in the US has been limiting for many communities and shaping our experiences. We will get the opportunity to build community and force in this workshop through sharing personal stories of immigration with resistance strategies and experience. Through this new lens of immigration and citizenship history, we can fight back against racism, xenophobia, and U.S imperialism.||
